    <h1>HTMLPlayer Terms of Service (TOS)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 9/23/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By using HTMLPlayer (the "App"), you agree to these Terms of Service. If
      you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>HTMLPlayer is a free, open-source music player.</li>
      <li>
        All core functionality runs client-side in your browser; we do not
        collect usage data except when explicitly interacting with external
        services like Discord.
      </li>
      <li>You may use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      HTMLPlayer and its source code are licensed under the
      <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank"
        >MIT License</a
      >. You may copy, modify, or redistribute the App according to the MIT
      License terms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Discord Integration</h2>
    <p>
      The App may optionally integrate with Discord to display music activity.
      Access to Discord features requires you to authorize HTMLPlayer via
      Discord OAuth. HTMLPlayer does not store your Discord credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Beta Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      HTMLPlayer is currently in beta. Features may be unstable or incomplete.
      Use at your own risk.
    </p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>
      The App is provided "as-is" without warranty of any kind, either express
      or implied. The developers are not liable for any damages arising from the
      use or inability to use HTMLPlayer.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      You use HTMLPlayer entirely at your own risk. Developers are not
      responsible for any loss, data corruption, or other issues resulting from
      your use of the App.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms at any time. Continued use constitutes
      acceptance of the updated Terms.
    </p>
