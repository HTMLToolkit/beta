    <h1>HTMLPlayer Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 9/23/2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      HTMLPlayer respects your privacy. Since the App is primarily client-side,
      we do not collect personal data unless you interact with external services
      (e.g., Discord integration).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>The App does not collect personal information by default.</li>
      <li>
        Optional Discord integration may send limited information (username,
        current activity) to Discordâ€™s servers for the purpose of updating your
        music activity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>
      HTMLPlayer does not use cookies or trackers for analytics or advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Discord integration is managed via OAuth; your authorization is handled by
      Discord directly. HTMLPlayer does not store Discord credentials or share
      data outside the Discord API.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
      All client-side operations run in your browser; no server-side storage of
      music or personal data occurs. We take no responsibility for security
      vulnerabilities in your browser or Discord.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      HTMLPlayer does not sell, trade, or share personal information with third
      parties, except through authorized use of Discord features.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Updates to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy as HTMLPlayer evolves. Continued use
      indicates acceptance of the latest policy.
    </p>
